# ScalableDeepLearningAccelerator
Scalable Deep Learning Accelerator Unit on FPGA

Deep Learning is an emerging field of machine learning and it shows amazing ability to solve complex learning problems. 
Although, as the size of networks keeps increasing day-by-day, due to demands of
more practical implementations, it becomes a significant challenge to create a high-performance application of
deep learning neural networks. In this paper, I present the design and architecture of deep learning scalable
accelerator unit, which helps improve the performance as well as maintain low power cost by
implementing large-scale deep learning networks using field-programmable gate array (FPGA) as a hardware
prototype.
